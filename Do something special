#Solution:
+ When we view the page source we can find:
   <a href="/gr@b_y#ur_fl@g_h3r3!" class="button btn btn-lg btn-success">Get the flag!</a>
 + When the url encode this link :` gr@b_y#ur_fl@g_h3r3! ` , we get this: gr%40b_y%23ur_fl%40g_h3r3!
 + When we give the encoded link with the url : https://do-something-special.kshackzone.com/gr%40b_y%23ur_fl%40g_h3r3!
 + Thus we get the flag: KCTF{Sp3cial_characters_need_t0_get_Url_enc0ded}
