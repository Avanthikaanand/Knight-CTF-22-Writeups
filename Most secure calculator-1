Hint: Hi Selina, 
        I learned about eval today and tomorrow I will learn about regex. I have build a calculator for your child.
        I have hidden some interesting things in flag.txt and I know you can read that file.

# solution:
+ The webpage uses 'eval' to do calculations
+ Flag is stored in flag.txt
+ Submitting 'system("cat flag.txt");' gives us the flag
+ ```Flag: KCTF{WaS_mY_cAlCuLaToR_sAfE}```
